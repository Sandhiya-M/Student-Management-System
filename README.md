     The technological development and impact of computers and internet on our lives has been verified over time affected various sectors of activity. And almost every task today is being run through computers. The aim of my mini project is to help faculties working at school in managing the student’s result after every examination.The project aims at creating a webpage for posting the marks of the students (especially school)and the students can even see it by logging through their roll numbers. The student can share or print his/her result.Class teachers of every class and every sections are given separate usernames and passwords such that they can access their class student’s mark and students can’t access the faculty’s portal since the passcode will be kept secret .Once the teacher logins  their respective class page will be opened hence they can either modify /update their class student’s marks.
This project will be useful for students and institutions for getting the results in simple manner.
